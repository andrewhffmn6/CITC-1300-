    <h1>A Basic Guide to a Music Festival</h1>
    <h2>What to know:</h2>
        <p> For music lovers, if they wanted to see their favorite musician live, concerts are a great experience. 
            Afterall, it creates a connection between the Musicians and the audience in a way that doesn't compare when just listening to a studio album. 
            Now imagine if someone decided to take a whole 3-4 days off to camp out at a concert of multiple musicians. 
            It no longer becomes just seeing the music live but an endurance test. See how long you can last until you're like "Ok, I'm ready to go home." </p>
        <p>The most important part is knowing what to bring. Most festivals will give you a list on their site of what you can and cannot bring, however there are some
            necessities that are a must-have in all Festival experiences.</p>

    <h3>Important Areas:</h3>
        <p>When going to these types of festivals, there are usually three areas that pretty much make up the festival.</p>
            <p>You have the Campsite, which is where you will consider your home for the time you're there.</p>
            <p>Then there is Shakedown Street, a term first used by the Grateful Dead, and this is where you will find Vendors selling merch and supplies.</p>
            <p>And most importantly, the Stage area, where the music is being played. Depending on how big the festival is, 
            there can be significant number of these types of areas all around.</p>

 <h3>The Festival Community:</h3> 
        <p>And of course what would a festival be without its community. When it comes to these types of festivals, there is a name given to those who make going to these festivals their identity.
            They are called Wooks and they are the elite festival-goers.</p>
