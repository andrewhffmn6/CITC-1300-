    <h1>Intro to HTML</h1>
    <h2>Random Info About HTML</h2>
        <p>As older generations make room for newer ones, certain subcultures rise up and replace older dominant ones. 
            One particular subculture evolved from a promonent one. By this I mean the Wook community that pervade music festivals.
            They are a community that trace their roots from what emerged when a few members of the hippie movement created the 
            music festival, Woodstock. 
        </p>
        <p>Because of this connection, Wooks are nomads who can be very resourceful in a camping atmosphere. They are initially drawn 
            to the music at the festival, but as they estabish their campsite, they connect with other wooks in the area and form 
            mini communities, lasting only as long as the festival lasts. </p>
