    <h1>The Transformative Experience of a Weekend-long Music Festival</h1>
    <h2>The Origins</h2>
        <p> If someone is a music lover, it would not be difficult to believe they would want to go to a concert. But this experience is limited, for it is experience that may only last a day.
            Now imagine if someone decided to take a whole 3-4 days off to camp out at a concert of multiple musicians. In our technologically convient society, this experience might go from 
            Fun and exciting to one based primarily on survival.</p>
        <p> I will dedicate this web page as a basic reference guide that can turn survival into transformitive experience that will make you want to continue going.</p>

    <h3>What to expect</h3>
        <p>When going to these types of festivals, there are usually three areas that is in every festival. You have the Campsite, which is where you will consider your home for the time you're there. Then there is Shakedown Street, a term first used by the Grateful Dead, where you will find Vendors selling merchandise. And most importantly, the Stage area, where the music is being played. Depending on how big the festival is, there can be significant number of these types of areas all around.</p>>
        <p>One last thing I want to add is a community that exists only because these festivals exist. That community are called Wooks, and they are a group that are rooted from the hippie movement. They are the true festival-goers.</p>
