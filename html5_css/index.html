            <h2>What makes the Pixel Remaster important?</h2>
        <hr>
            <p>The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series is a vital preservation project that brings the franchise's foundational 8-bit and 16-bit classics to a new audience.
                For those of us old school gamers who grew up in the 90's, it cannot be overstated how the company Squaresoft shaped the role-playing genre.
                What the Pixel Remaster brings is a revitalization of the classic mechanics that shaped the genre afterwards. 
                By faithfully recreating the original pixel art with enhanced resolution, music arranged with real instruments, and better dialogue for storytelling, players can now 
                experience on the newer consoles the games that laid the foundations for a series that continues to entertain players, 40 years later.</p>
            <p>For those interested, there are a few videos on the Series history from the 8-bit to the 16-bit era:</p>

            He was the director for the first 5 games. Because of the major success of the Series, he was promoted to an executive position,
            where he took the role of Producer for the sixth game. Despite this change, he still had a major hand in the direction of the game.
            As the player plays each of the games, they can see what ideas that were decided to permeated the series that ultimately </p>
           
            <p>His influence has spread throughout the company, influencing all other rpg games that were produced by Squaresoft and beyond. 
                The 2026 Game of the Year winner, Clair Obscur by developer Sandfall, praised Sakaguchi's influence on their game. </p>
