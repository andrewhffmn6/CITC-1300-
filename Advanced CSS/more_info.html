  <p><b>The story follows a traveler named Bartz who investigates a fallen meteorite and meets a group of strangers with a shared destiny.

The heroes travel between two parallel worlds to prevent the return of the "Void," a power capable of erasing existence. Throughout their journey, they inherit the abilities of the crystals, allowing for a highly refined and deep Job System. The narrative balances lighthearted adventure with moments of profound grief, particularly regarding the legacy of the Dawn Warriors. Ultimately, Bartz and his companions must enter the Interdimensional Rift to face Exdeath in his final, monstrous form.</b></p>

<hr>

  <p><b>In a world where magic has been replaced by industrial technology, an ambitious Empire seeks to reclaim the lost power of the Espers. The story centers on Terra Branford, a young woman with innate magical abilities who escapes the Empire's control and joins a rebel group called the Returners. The narrative features a large ensemble cast, each with their own complex motivations and tragic backstories, ranging from a treasure hunter to a grieving general. The plot takes a shocking turn when the villainous jester Kefka Palazzo successfully destroys the world's balance, ushering in the apocalyptic World of Ruin. The second half of the game focuses on the scattered heroes finding hope and reuniting to take down Kefka in his god-like state. It is widely regarded as a masterpiece for its mature themes, operatic score, and one of the most effective villains in gaming history. This was the final entry in the series to be released on a 16-bit console.</b></p>
