    <p><b>Set in a world under siege, the narrative follows four orphans from the kingdom of Fynn whose lives are shattered by the Palamecian Empire. After being rescued by the rebel army, Firion, Maria, and Guy join the resistance to stop the Emperor’s quest for world domination.

Along the way, they face tragic losses, including the apparent death of Maria’s brother, Leon, who later reappears as a dark knight.

  <p><b>The world is plunged into darkness when a massive earthquake traps the four elemental crystals and threatens the balance of nature. Four orphans are chosen by the Wind Crystal to become the new Warriors of Light and are granted the power to change their professions through the Job System. As they explore the Floating Continent and the world below, they discover that a powerful sorcerer named Xande is trying to stop time itself.

  <p><b>The story follows a traveler named Bartz who investigates a fallen meteorite and meets a group of strangers with a shared destiny. They soon discover that the elemental crystals, which govern the world's natural forces, are shattering one by one. This destruction is part of a plot to release Exdeath, an ancient warlock who was sealed within a forest centuries ago. The heroes travel between two parallel worlds to prevent the return of the "Void," a power capable of erasing existence. Throughout their journey, they inherit the abilities of the crystals, allowing for a highly refined and deep Job System. The narrative balances lighthearted adventure with moments of profound grief, particularly regarding the legacy of the Dawn Warriors. Ultimately, Bartz and his companions must enter the Interdimensional Rift to face Exdeath in his final, monstrous form.</b></p>

  <p><b>In a world where magic has been replaced by industrial technology, an ambitious Empire seeks to reclaim the lost power of the Espers. The story centers on Terra Branford, a young woman with innate magical abilities who escapes the Empire's control and joins a rebel group called the Returners. The narrative features a large ensemble cast, each with their own complex motivations and tragic backstories, ranging from a treasure hunter to a grieving general. The plot takes a shocking turn when the villainous jester Kefka Palazzo successfully destroys the world's balance, ushering in the apocalyptic World of Ruin. The second half of the game focuses on the scattered heroes finding hope and reuniting to take down Kefka in his god-like state. It is widely regarded as a masterpiece for its mature themes, operatic score, and one of the most effective villains in gaming history. This was the final entry in the series to be released on a 16-bit console.</b></p>
